First, you store a fixed username (dinesh) and password (12345).

The program then asks the user to enter a username.

If the entered username matches the stored one, it continues to ask for a password.

If the entered password also matches, it prints “Login Successful”.

If the password is wrong, it prints “Incorrect Password”.

If the username itself is wrong, it prints “Incorrect Username”.
